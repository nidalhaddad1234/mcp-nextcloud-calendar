## Why Modular Documentation?

Breaking the migration guide into smaller, focused documents provides several benefits:

1. **Easier maintenance** - Each section can be updated independently
2. **Improved readability** - Shorter documents are easier to navigate
3. **Modular implementation** - Teams can work on different aspects in parallel
4. **Progressive adoption** - Migration can be done in stages
